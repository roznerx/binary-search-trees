# "Binary Search Trees Project" for The Odin Project 

Made by **roznerx** (ignaciorosner@gmail.com)

## Notes [01/25/2024]:

- Not really a project but more of a practice for *Binary Search Trees*, which is part of the new "A Bit of Computer Science" section.
- The battle goes on! This "A Bit of Computer Science" section is destroying me: the HashMap was quite difficult, and I feel this one might be the hardest yet!
